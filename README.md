CRUD Operations: Create, Read, Update, and Delete tasks seamlessly.
Responsive Design: Utilizes Tailwind CSS for a modern and adaptive user interface.
Efficient Backend: Node.js ensures robust server-side functionality.
Scalable Database: MongoDB provides flexibility and scalability for data management.
This project showcases a comprehensive implementation of the MERN stack, highlighting proficiency in full-stack development and delivering a user-friendly task management solution.
