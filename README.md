MERN Stack Task Management System
This project implements a Task Management System using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). It facilitates CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing tasks efficiently. The frontend is built with React and styled using Tailwind CSS for responsive and sleek design elements. Node.js powers the backend, handling server-side logic and API integrations, while MongoDB serves as the database for flexible and scalable data storage.
